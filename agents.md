# AI Agent Guidelines

> This file contains instructions and rules for AI assistants (like Z, Cursor, or other coding agents) interacting with this repository.

## 1. Version Control & Pushing
- **DO NOT automatically push to the remote repository.**
- The user prefers to review all commits and perform the push themselves.
- You may stage and commit changes locally if part of a task, but **always stop before pushing** and leave that step to the user.

## 2. Editor & Syntax Best Practices
- **Indentation:** Use **TABS** for indentation (not spaces), except where rigidly required by a schema (like YAML). For all other code (HTML, CSS, JS, Markdown, etc.), use tabs.
- **Trailing Whitespace:** Remove trailing whitespace from modified lines.
- **File Endings:** Ensure all files end with a single newline character.
## 3. Documentation Standards
- **No Emojis:** Do not use emojis in any Markdown (`.md`) files. Documentation should remain clean and professional without decorative symbols.
